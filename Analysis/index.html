    <h1>RNA Folding problem</h1>
    <p>This is a famous problem in biology where one needs to predict the most
        optimal secondary structures of mRNA molecule. This can be acheieved by maximising
        the count of base-pairs (Adenine with Uracil or Guanine with Cytosine) while ensuring
        there are no knots and kinks in the final pairing. The hypotheses is that making
        many base pairs will reduce the free energy of the molecule and hence make it much
        more stable and liklely to actually exist (some anomalies can exist tho).
    </p>
    <h2>Demonstration</h2>
    <img src="./demonstrate.png">
    <p>Let's run the algorithm step-by-step on a RNA molecule. Condsider an RNA molecule can be represented as a string as RNA = GAAGGAGUCGUUCAU 
        with the length of n = 15 nucleotides. Now this problem will involve dynamic programming as we are supposed to find the optimal structure 
        by maximising the number of base-pairs while ensuring its knot & kink free.
    </p>
    <h3>What are knots/kinks?</h3>
    <p>Knots/kinks are created in molecules when the two adjacent nucleotides make a pair, this will make the bonds
        to constrained and hence increase the free energy. Now to ensure that pairs have sufficent space to form bonds 
        with each other, two adjacent nucleotides which can form a pair must have minimum 4 bases between them.
    </p>
    <h3>Programming Formulation</h3>
    <p>We are dealing with chemical molecules so it would be great if we can build a programming representation for 
        molecules so that they can be easily manipulated by algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>RNA molecule can be represented as a c++ string from set {A, U, G, C}</p>
    <code>
        std :: string RNA = "GAAGGAGUCGUUCAU";
    </code>
    <p>The output secondary structure can be represented as an ordering of compatible base-pairs</p>
    <code>
        std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; secondaryStruct = {(..., ...)};
    </code>
    <p>As we discussed above elements in a pair should be compatible (A with U or G with C),
        for this a boolean function can be built which can compare bases at the required indexes
        in the RNA string and tell us if they can be paired.
    </p>
    <code>
        bool RNApairing(const std::string& RNA, int i, int j);
    </code>
    <p>Finally, to avoid the knot situation, we will make sure that the pairing elements in our
        secondary structure need to be more than 4 indexes apart. Programmatically, we will evaluate
        all those cases only where indexes follow the above condition.
    </p>
    <code>
        optValue(i, j) = 0 // if i >= j - 4
    </code>
    <h3>Defining Problem</h3>
    <p>Now, we are ready to formulate our problem. We are given an RNA molecule <code>"GAAGGAGUCGUUCAU"</code>, we
        will define two table classes <code>optValue(RNA.size())</code> (to get optimal count of base-pairs) and <code>optChoice(RNA.size())</code>
        (to get the pairs which actually were present in the base-pair construction). We want the ordering which
        following all constraints gives the maximum no. of pairs.
    </p>
    <h3>Defining Recurrence</h3>
    <p>This is a crucial part of DP algorithm, this can then be converted to bottom-up approach using Tables later.. 
        we will fill the <code>optValue(n)</code> and <code>optChoice(n)</code> table using following conditions, although its not
        recurrence as intended in title, the operations are derived from it.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Base Case:</b>
            <p>Now due to knot condition, our both the tables should have '0':</p>
            <code>
                optValue(i, j) = 0;
                optChoice(i, j) = 0;
                iff i >= j - 4;
            </code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Recursive/Iterative case</b>
            <p>Here, we have further two cases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>if i & j are pairable</b>
                    <p>consider all those indices 't' such that j and t pair and <code>j &lt; t - 4</code>, we 
                        will get two sub-problems for our <code>optValue(i, j)</code>, one being <code>optValue(i, t - 1)</code>
                        and other being <code>optValue(t + 1, j - 1)</code>, thus we iterate over all possible t's and find maximum 
                        value of : <code>optValue(i, t - 1) + optValue(t + 1, j - 1) + 1</code>
                        As for <code>optChoice(i, j)</code>, we just fill the maximum 't' we found which made pair with our 'j'.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>if i & j are not pairable</b>
                    <p>When this occurs, simply put:</p>
                    <code>optValue(i, j) = optValue(i, j - 1);</code>
                    <p>and for choice table, we will make it 0</p>
                    <code>optChoice(i, j) = 0;</code>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>For <code>optValue(i, j)</code> we get maxima of the two above values possible and equate it to <code>optValue(i, j)</code></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Final algorithms</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Optimal Pair calculation</h4>
            <p>Below is the pseudo-code implemented to fill the choice and value tables</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                Intialise optChoice(i,j) = optValue(i, j) = 0
                for k = 5, 6, ....., n - 1:
                    For i = 0, 1, 2, ...., n - k: // 0-based indexing
                        set j = i + k;
                        compute optChoice(i, j) & optValue(i, j) using above rules
                    Endfor
                Endfor
                return optChoice & optValue tables!
                </pre>
            </code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Base-pair construction</h4>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    getStruct(i, j, output):
                        Take the pre-filled optChoice(i, j)
                        Base case:
                            if i >= j - 4, then:
                                // don't do anything
                        Endfor
                        
                        Recursive case:
                            if the optChoice(i, j) != 0: // a 't' exists which can form pair 
                                output.emplace(pair(t,j))
                                getStruct(i, t - 1, output)
                                getStruct(t + 1, j - 1, output)
                            else:
                                getStruct(i, j - 1, output)
                        Endfor
                    return output
                </pre>
            </code>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <b>Appropriate memoization have been done for both the algorithms (dp & backtracking one) to optimize running time!</b>
    <h3>Final output</h3>
    <p>After running the algorithms, we finally get our optimal ordering of base-pairs as:</p>
    <code style="font-size: 18px;"><b>S= {(1,13), (2,12), (3,11), (4,9)}</b></code>
    <p>Following are the tables filled to reach above output</p>
    <div>
        <div class="choice" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px; text-align: center;">
            <img src="./choice-table.png">
            <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>optChoice table</b></p>
        </div>
        <div class="value" style="display: inline-block; text-align: center;">
            <img src="./value-table.png">
            <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>optValue table</b></p>
        </div>
    </div>      
    <h3>Complexity Analysis</h3>
    <h4>Optimal base pair Algorithm</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Initalizing both the tables with 0's takes <b>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</b> running time.</li>
        <li>Iterating over <b>k</b> and <b>i</b> to cover all possible cells takes <b>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</b> running time.</li>
        <li>But inside, there is a condition in which we might need to re-iterate <b>t</b> over <b>i</b> and <b>j - 4</b> which will take <b>O(n)</b> running time.</li>
        <li>Hence, in the end we will get over all <b>O(n<sup>2</sup>) + O(n<sup>2</sup>) * O(n) ~ O(n<sup>3</sup>)</b></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hence the running time for this algo is <b>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</b></p>
    <h4>Base pair construction Algorithm</h4>
    <p>Without memoization the algorithm will have <b>O(2<sup>n</sup>)</b> complexity, but memoizing it
        makes the function call itself only on distinct pairs of <b>(i, j)</b>, hence in worst case it will 
        go over all unique combinations of <b>(i, j)</b> which will make complexity quadratic as <b>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <p>Some minor things done to optimize performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Used references for complex objects which are costly to copy..
        </li>
        <li>
            Used <code>const</code> at appropriate positions to preserve the container while
            the function accesses data from it.. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Memoization used which is trivial for a dp problem..
        </li>
    </ol>
