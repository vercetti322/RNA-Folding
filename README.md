# RNA-Folding
This is a dynamic programming implementation with an tkinter and matplotlib (python) visualization of conversion from mRNA to most optimal secondary structure (most number of base pairs). The main algorithm is implemented and tested in C++. The documentation has been made for code and analysis HTML pages too.
